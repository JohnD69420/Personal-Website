    Welcome to my website! I am a second year Computer Science Major at Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. I love music, and have been playing instruments for more than 10 years.
    I like to play my guitar, hang out with my friends and family, and eat new food. If you need a dedicated programmer, or just someone to talk to, just click the contact me link and send me a message. Thanks for stopping by and have a good day:)
